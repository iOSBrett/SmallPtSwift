#  SmallPtSwift

My Swift port of SmallPt the C++ Path Tracer in 99 lines of code.
See README_SmallptCpp.md for original README

I am currently writing my own Path Tracer in Swift. I want a reference path tracer in Swift that I can use to easily compare calculations and images so I ported the SmallPt C++ one.
